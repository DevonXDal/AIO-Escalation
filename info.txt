ICBM MOD "Mutually Assured Overhaul"

Version "0.3"

Description "THIS IS A PRERELEASE VERSION THAT LACKS TWEAKS, UNITS, TECHS, DEFCON, ETC. PLEASE GIVE ANOTHER TWO WEEKS FOR THE FULL RELEASE.
Version 0.6 will be released approximately one week from this release. It will include many new units, DEFCON, and related systems.
Version 1.0 will likely include campaigns, optimizations, tweaks, etc.

This is effectively meant to be the largest mod for ICBM Escalation. Its AIO or all-in-one mod. Effectively overhauling the game in so many ways that it is as though the game had seen multiple major version releases.

To briefly list what has been added: ~100 leader portraits; placeholder portraits with ids to make other mods with leader portraits easier to coordinate; a revised DEFCON system taken to a new level from its original mod; a noticeably overhauled economy system (optional with tiers of options); national focuses (optional but one max); unit specializations (which trade certain stats for others); more defensive structures; more ground units; more sound tracks; more campaigns; revised AI playstyle; capital cities; reworked existing units; an initial slowdown to reaching nuclear tech to make its entrance more impactful; etc.

Want a single mod that almost every other player has, that has language files created for non-English speaking players, overhauls basically every area of the game, and massively increases how dynamic each game ends up playing out? This is the mod for you.
